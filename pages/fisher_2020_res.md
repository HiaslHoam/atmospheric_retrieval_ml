* The high overall accuracy should not fool one to blindly trust the model
* Compared to Robovetter, the model has problems with identifying false mock signals
* Because of that, there is still a need for manual supervision
* Dispite this being very accurate while only used on limited data only, the Autovetter actually is already able to do all of this quite well

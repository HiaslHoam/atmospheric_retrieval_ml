  * The $R^2$ value for the BNN is better throughout
  * The ensemble of five BNNs is performing better than just one

  * Although the RF is performing worse, it is not that big of a difference
  * Considering the complexity and computational cost of the BNN, I'm not convinced that this is a big improvement

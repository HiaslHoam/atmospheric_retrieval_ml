# Atmospheric Retrieval Using Machine Learning
This is a [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) presentation about four papers in which machine learning techniques are used to infer atmospheric parameters of exoplanets.

The Papers are:

## An Ensemble of Bayesian Neural Networks for Exoplanetary Atmospheric Retrieval

## ExoGAN: Retrieving Exoplanetary Atmospheres Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aae77c/pdf

## Interpreting High-resolution Spectroscopy of Exoplanets using Cross-correlations and Supervised Machine Learning (Fisher et al. 2020)
